## Instructions for Agents

### Phase 1: Pattern Detection

The skill can be triggered in two ways:

#### Automatic Detection
Monitor conversations for these patterns:

1. **Recurring Task Patterns**: User requests similar types of tasks multiple times
2. **Specific Tool Sequences**: Particular tool combinations being used repeatedly
3. **Domain Knowledge**: Specialized domain workflows appearing in conversation
4. **Complex Multi-step Processes**: Fixed-step operations that could be standardized

**Detection Signals:**
- User says "我经常需要..." (I often need to...)
- Similar requests appear 3+ times in a session
- User asks "这个可以做成一个技能吗?" (Can this be made into a skill?)
- Agent performs same complex workflow repeatedly

#### Manual Trigger
User explicitly uses activation keywords.

### Phase 2: Extraction Process

#### Step 1: Identify Skill Candidate
Analyze the conversation pattern to identify:
- **Core Purpose**: What problem does this pattern solve?
- **Target Audience**: Who would use this skill?
- **Reusability**: Can this be applied in different contexts?
- **Completeness**: Does it have all necessary components?

#### Step 2: Extract Key Elements

**From the conversation pattern, extract:**

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Skill Name** | Concise English name with hyphens | `stock-analyzer`, `git-workflow` |
| **Description** | 1-2 sentences of functionality | "Analyzes stock data using AkShare API" |
| **Activation Keywords** | Trigger phrases (Chinese + English) | "股票分析", "stock analysis" |
| **Tools Used** | Required tools and their usage | `exec: Run Python scripts` |
| **Usage Patterns** | Typical use cases | "Analyze single stock", "Compare stocks" |
| **Instructions** | Step-by-step workflow | 1. Fetch data, 2. Calculate indicators... |
| **Error Handling** | Common issues and solutions | "If API fails: retry after 3 seconds" |

#### Step 3: Generate SKILL.md Content

Use the project template format. The generated SKILL.md must include:

```markdown
# [Skill Name]

## Description
[1-2 sentence description]

## Activation Keywords
- [keyword1]
- [keyword2]
- [keyword3]

## Tools Used
- [tool1]: [usage description]
- [tool2]: [usage description]

## Usage Patterns

```

#### Step 4: User Confirmation

**Display the extracted skill suggestion:**

```markdown
🔴🔴🔴 **[技能提炼建议]** 🔴🔴🔴

检测到对话中有可复用的技能模式：

**技能名称**: `your-skill-name`
**简要描述**: [技能功能描述]
**激活关键词**: [检测到的关键词]

---

**提取的关键要素:**

## Description
[description]

## Activation Keywords
- [keyword1]
- [keyword2]

## Tools Used
- [tool1]: [usage]

---

**预计生成目录结构:**
```
collection/skills/your-skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── examples/
└── references/
```

**是否将此模式提炼为新技能？**
- 回复 "确认" 或 "yes" 创建技能
- 回复 "修改 [内容]" 修改特定部分
- 回复 "跳过" 或 "skip" 跳过此次建议
```

#### Step 5: Create Skill Files

After user confirmation:

1. **Create directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p collection/skills/{skill-name}/{examples,references,assets,scripts}
   ```

2. **Write SKILL.md:** Using extracted content

3. **Create supporting files:**
   - `examples/usage-examples.md`: Usage examples
   - `references/` if applicable
   - `scripts/` if Python/scripts are needed

4. **Update project indices:**
   - Add entry to `SKILLS.md`
   - Update `CLAUDE.md` if needed

5. **Save to memory:**
   - Record skill in `memory/skills.md`
   - Include: name, path, extraction date, source pattern

### Phase 3: Validation

After creating the skill, validate:

1. **Format Compliance**: Check SKILL.md follows template
2. **No Duplicates**: Verify no existing skill with same purpose
3. **Testable**: Instructions are clear and actionable
4. **Complete**: All required sections are present

## Context Files

### templates/skill-template.md
Project's standard SKILL.md template

### collection/skills/*/SKILL.md
Existing skills for reference and pattern matching

### memory/skills.md
Cross-session memory of extracted skills

## Error Handling

### Duplicate Skill Detected
```
If skill already exists:
  1. Inform user of existing skill
  2. Show differences between patterns
  3. Ask if they want to:
     - Update existing skill
     - Create as variant/alternative
     - Skip creation
```

### Incomplete Pattern
```
If extracted pattern is incomplete:
  1. Identify missing elements
  2. Ask user for missing information
  3. Provide suggestions based on similar skills
  4. Allow user to fill gaps manually
```

### Ambiguous Pattern
```
If pattern is not clear:
  1. Ask clarifying questions
  2. Provide multiple interpretations
  3. Let user choose the best approach
  4. Extract what's clear, ask for rest
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Specific Activation Keywords
- Avoid generic terms ("help", "do", "make")
- Use domain-specific phrases ("kdj indicator", "golden cross")
- Include both Chinese and English variants
- Test keywords are unique enough

### 2. Clear Instructions
- Write step-by-step instructions
- Include conditional logic (if X, then Y)
- Provide fallback options
- Reference specific tools and parameters

### 3. Comprehensive Examples
- Show typical usage scenarios
- Include edge cases
- Demonstrate error handling
- Use realistic user requests

### 4. Proper Documentation
- Add relevant references
- Include external resources
- Link to related skills
- Document limitations

### 5. Memory Integration
- Save extracted skills to memory
- Cross-reference similar patterns
- Track skill usage over time
- Update based on user feedback

## Examples

### Example 1: Manual Extraction Request

```
User: "提炼一个技能：从这段对话中，我一直在请求分析股票数据，
     你在用 AkShare 获取数据，计算技术指标，生成图表。"

Agent Process:
1. Analyzes conversation history
2. Identifies the stock analysis pattern:
   - Uses AkShare API
   - Calculates technical indicators (MA, MACD, KDJ)
   - Generates visualizations
   - Produces Markdown reports

3. Extracts key elements:
   - Skill Name: stock-analysis
   - Description: "Comprehensive stock technical analysis using AkShare"
   - Keywords: stock analysis, 股票分析, technical indicators
   - Tools: exec, read, write

4. Generates SKILL.md content

5. Displays suggestion with 🔴 markers

6. User confirms "yes"

7. Creates files and updates indices
```

### Example 2: Auto-Detection

```
[Conversation context: User has asked 3 times to format SQL queries]

   - Formats output for display
3. Extracts skill pattern:
   - Skill Name: weather-fetcher
   - Description: "Fetch and display weather data from API"
   - Keywords: weather, 天气, forecast
4. Generates SKILL.md with Python-specific instructions
5. Creates skill with scripts/ subdirectory
```

## Advanced Features

### Pattern Recognition Hints
Look for these indicators when auto-detecting:

| Indicator | Example Pattern |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Repetition | Same task requested 3+ times |
| Complexity | 5+ steps in a workflow |
| Domain Specific | Uses specialized terminology |
| Tool Combination | Specific tools used together |
| User Explicit | "Can this be saved/remembered?" |

### Cross-Session Learning
- Store extracted patterns in memory
- Build skill library over time
- Suggest related skills based on context
- Learn from user confirmations/rejections

### Skill Relationships
When extracting, check for:
- Parent/child skill relationships
- Complementary skills
- Conflicting skills
- Dependencies on other skills

## Limitations

- Cannot extract skills from very short conversations (< 3 exchanges)
- Requires clear, repeatable patterns
- Manual confirmation always required
- May need user input for domain-specific details
- Cannot validate extracted skills work without testing

## Notes

- This is a "meta-skill" - it creates other skills
- Always requires user confirmation before creating files
- Extracted skills should be tested after creation
- Consider creating variants for different use cases
- Update memory system for cross-session learning
- Skills are most valuable when they capture domain expertise
